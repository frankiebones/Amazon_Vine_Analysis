Determining if there is any bias regarding favorable reviews within the Amazon Vine program.

# Overview
By comparing the most helpful reviews of Vine members and non-members alike we are able to visualize the percentage of 5-star reviews in relation to the total of all reviews. 

# Results
We filtered our data to include only those reviews with 20 or more total votes whose helpful votes made up 50% or more of the total votes.<br> 
We then split the Vine member reviews and the non-Vine member reviews to easily compare them.<br>

Further filtering to remove those reviews that are not linked to a verified purchase may provide additional insight as to a more accurate percentage of 5-star reviews vs overall reviews.
